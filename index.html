            <p>Dear friends,</p>
            <p>I am deeply honored to have been elected as your Class Representative. This would not have been possible without your incredible support, trust, and encouragement throughout the campaign. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to each and every one of you who voted for me, shared your ideas, and believed in my vision for a more united and active class environment.</p>
            <p>With your continued involvement, we can work together to ensure that everyone's voice is heard and that we create a positive experience for all of us. As your CR, I am committed to representing you all with dedication and transparency. Feel free to reach out to me anytime with suggestions or concerns. Thank you once again for this opportunity, and I look forward to making our class an even better place!</p>
            <p>With gratitude,<br>Shubham</p>
